This package of codes generates Table 3 in the draft
"Towards a Mathematical Foundation of Immunology and Amino Acid Chains"
available at arXiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6031v2

The C dynamic library should be compiled in unix-like system
(e.g. MacOS, Linux) since POSIX thread tool is used. To compile,
just type

$ make

and the Makefile script will finish all the things.

The main program is the R file "gen.Tab3.R" which will output
an R data package "reportsPan" from where the predicted
binding affinity can be found. These values are used to generate
the Table 1 mentioned above. To run it, try

$ Rscipt gen.Tab3.R

Note that the codes need very much memory (about 50GB) and may take days to finish.
